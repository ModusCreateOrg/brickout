Brickout is a cross-platform a block-breaking game developed by [Modus Create](https://moduscreate.com) to demonstrate how to use the creative engine library. Brickout runs on the [ODROID GO](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-go/), macOS and Linux.

## How to Play
Genus is a simple puzzle game where the objective is to match colors in 2x2 patterns. Once a 2x2 pattern is found, the blocks will be darken as they are marked for clearing. A bonus timer will appear. As the timer runs out, you can create additional color matches. Themore matches you create, the higher your score will be.  Play until you run out of spaces to place new blocks.

The game's difficulty increases as you progress through levels. There are a total of five stages in the game, each with different backgrounds, songs and color themes.

On the ODROID GO, the instructions can be found on our play cards (front, back).
